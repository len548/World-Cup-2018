        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The FIFA World Cup for men is held every four year. </p>
        <p>The last one took place in Russia in 2018 with 60 exciting matches in it.</p>
        <p>We've seen quite the competition, filled with emotion and crazy moments. </p>
        <p>There's been tons of late drama, 157 goals and tons of upsets. </p>
        <p>But out of 60 matches, what are the most entertaining? </p>
        <p>I guess everyone has their own best matches, </p>
        <p>but I’m going to introduce three of the best matches that must lead you to fun of football.</p>
        <p>Also, you can see a table of top 4 to 10 mathces below</p>
        <h2>Best 3 matches</h2>
        <h3>Japan vs Belgium</h3>

            <p>Japan vs Belgium</p>
            <p>Score: Japan 2 , Belgium 3</p>
            <p>Stage: Round of 16</p>
            <p>Why: As good of a comeback as you'll see. Japan took a 2-0 lead in early in the second half, and the Red Devils managed to come all the way back. Goals from Jan Vertongen, Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli cemented the comeback, with the last goal coming in the final minutes off one of the most clinical counters you'll see. What a game for everybody but Japan.</p>

           

            

        
        <h3>France vs Argentina</h3>

        <p>France vs Argentina</p>
        <p>Score: France 4 , Argenti 3</p>
        <p>Stage: Round of 16</p>
        <p>Why: This was the highest scoring game of the cup, it saw Argentina come back from a goal down, it saw France come back from a goal down, and it also featured two of the best goals with Angel Di Maria and Benjamin Pavard. For a neutral fan, this match was likely one of the most entertaining because of the number of goals and good-looking ones at that. What a match.</p>
        <h3>Portugal vs Spain</h3>

        <p>Portugal vs Spain</p>
        <p>Score: Portugal 3, Spain 3</p>
        <p>Stage: Group Stage</p>
        <p>Why: So much familiarity here with Cristiano Ronaldo teammates with roughly half of the Spanish team in La Liga. And the match gave us everything but a winner. A hat trick from Ronaldo, a controversial penalty kick, a golazo from Nacho and an absolutely world-class free kick late from CR7 to split the points. This was on Day 2 of the World Cup, and it was perfect foreshadowing of what was to come -- an amazing tournament filled with tons of incredible moments. </p>
